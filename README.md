## Reinforcement Learning: Temporal-Difference Methods
## Mini Project: OpenAI Gym: CliffWalkingEnv

## Project Overview

In the CliffWalking environment, the agent navigates a 4x12 gridworld. Temporal-Difference Methods are implemented to teach an agent to walk through the grid without falling off the cliff using OpenAI Gym.

   This is a simple implementation of the Gridworld Cliff
   reinforcement learning task.
   Adapted from Example 6.6 from Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction

   With inspiration from:
   https://github.com/dennybritz/reinforcement-learning/blob/master/lib/envs/cliff_walking.py
   The board is a 4x12 matrix, with (using Numpy matrix indexing):
       [3, 0] as the start at bottom-left
       [3, 11] as the goal at bottom-right
       [3, 1..10] as the cliff at bottom-center
   Each time step incurs -1 reward, and stepping into the cliff incurs -100 reward
   and a reset to the start. An episode terminates when the agent reaches the goal.
